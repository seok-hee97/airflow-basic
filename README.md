### Introduction to Apache Airflow in Python
(Interactive Course)


### Description
Now Updated to Apache Airflow 2.7 - Delivering data on a schedule can be a manual process. You write scripts, add complex cron tasks, 
and try various ways to meet an ever-changing set of requirements—and it's even trickier to manage everything when working with teammates.
Apache Airflow can remove this headache by adding scheduling, error handling, and reporting to your workflows.
In this course, you'll master the basics of Apache Airflow and learn how to implement complex data engineering pipelines in production.
You'll also learn how to use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), automate data engineering workflows, 
and implement data engineering tasks in an easy and repeatable fashion—helping you to maintain your sanity.
